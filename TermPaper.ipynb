    "A vast range of factors with significant uncertainties must be considered when assessing salmonid habitat restoration projects in rivers. The RiverArchitect software described in Schwindt et al. (2019) estimates the cost of different restoration projects, the spatial distribution of stage-dependent salmonid habitat suitability throughout the modeled area, as well as the expected lifespan of the habitat areas (as they are subject to change via morphodynamic processes). A common restoration procedure in rivers which are deprived of sediment (e.g. due to damming) is gravel augmentation. The introduction of gravel and fine sediments into the river channel may enhance the suitability of salmonid habitat, however, once the sediment is transported downstream, the habitat suitability of the river reach may decrease again. Using larger gravel will increase the lifespan of the restoration features, but if the gravel is too large it will also be unsuitable for salmonid habitat. Therefore, one might want to optimize a gravel distribution throughout a river reach of interest by maximizing the habitat suitability and restoration feature lifespan. In this case, we will consider habitat suitability for spawning rainbow/steelhead trout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The habitat suitability of a parameter of interest can be quantified by a habitat suitability index ($HSI$), a function which ranges from $0$ to $1$, with $1$ indicating ideal habitat for the species. RiverArchitect includes a module for calculating spatially explicit habitat suitability throughout a river reach. A composite habitat suitability index $cHSI$ is then taken as the geometric mean of $HSI$ values for all parameters of interest. In this application, the $cHSI(q, D)$ is taken as a function of depth and velocity (and in turn discharge $q$) as well as substrate size $D$:\n",

    "Given the flood frequency distribution for the river reach, the lifespan of a restoration feature can be estimated as the recurrence interval of the corresponding flood at which the sediment becomes mobilized.
